### Installation: The first step was making sure web pack was installed and any dependencies I would need. Then I updated the database and install java script files to include the logic that would make this application run properly. 

### Usage: This app is a great example of using progressive we apps, and a neat way to save text locally through a text editor.

### Credits: I watched multiple tutorials to help with this project, and also referred to class lessons.
